# K-Town Carshare
A website for an imaginary carshare service. Built from Php and MySQL

## Getting Started:

* Follow the [XAMPP instalation guide](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to setup an Apache Web Server on your machine. 
	* Open the XAMPP manager desktop application and in the "Manage Servers" tab, select "Apache Web Server" and click start. 
	* When the status changes to Running, open a web browser and search "localhost/dashboard". If you see a XAMPP welome page, then everything is probably working.

* In your terminal, navigate to XAMPP/htdocs and clone the repository using `$git clone https://github.com/qwalley/KTCS.git` on UNIX systems.

* Open a web browser and search "localhost/KTCS/src". You should see a very ugly website welcoming you to the home page.
